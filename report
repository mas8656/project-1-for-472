Description of the Project
The goal of this project is to create a file processing system that can determine how frequently a certain word appears in a number of huge text files. Both multiprocessing and multithreading are used by the system to improve efficiency and performance. Every file is handled by a different process, and each process has several threads that read different parts of the file simultaneously.

Overview of Multiprocessing and Multithreading
Multiprocessing: This method enables each file to operate independently by generating a distinct process for it. Each process can run on a separate CPU core, which is advantageous for CPU-bound tasks.
Multithreading: To read and process parts of the file, several threads are generated within each process. This method can result in greater resource use, particularly for I/O-bound tasks, and is lighter than establishing distinct processes.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages
Multiprocessing:
Parallel execution results in better CPU utilization.
Process isolation lowers the possibility of memory corruption.
Multithreading:
less memory burden than when multiprocessing is used.
quicker thread-to-thread context changes.
Disadvantages
Multiprocessing:
Higher memory consumption due to separate process memory spaces.
Overhead of process creation and management.
Multithreading:
Complexity in managing shared data and synchronization.
Potential for race conditions if not managed properly.



Structure of the Code
For readability and maintainability, the code is divided into several modules. The primary purposes are:
count_words: A thread function that keeps track of how many times a word appears in a file.
primary: controls word counting and initializes threads and processes.

Implementation Description
Process Management
For every file that has to be processed, the system creates a child process using fork().
The word count in each child process is managed by the corresponding file.

IPC Mechanism
Although threading within each process is the main emphasis of this design, IPC techniques like pipes or message queues for result sharing between processes may be included in later versions.
Threading
To efficiently handle reading and counting, each process uses POSIX threads, often known as pthreads, to establish many threads. 
Error Handling
Issues with thread management, process formation errors, and file access are all handled with appropriate error handling.

Discussion
Challenges
maintaining data integrity while controlling thread synchronization.
Finding a balance between the expense of multiprocessing and the intricacy of multithreading
Observations
While multithreading was more effective for jobs that were I/O-bound, multiprocessing performed better for operations that required a lot of CPU power.
For best performance, file partitioning and thread workload must be carefully planned.
Limitations and Improvements
IPC for combining results from several processes is absent from the existing implementation. Mechanisms for improved process communication may be included in future enhancements.
For simpler debugging and performance monitoring, improved error handling and logging can be included.
